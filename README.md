SIR model with subpopulations, like here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04073

Subpopulations are intended to be a spatial discretion into loosely coupled regions (like whole cities). 
By loosely coupled I mean the transmission matrix is sparse and of diagonal entries are much smaller than diagonal entries.
